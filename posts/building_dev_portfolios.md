# Building project portfolios

Regardless of whether you're positioning yourself as front-end, back-end, full-stack, QA, or what-have-you...you need projects that showcase those skills.

Build projects to showcase every single aspect of your learning. Share all your best code on Github so others can see your portfolio and possibly even use the code you've written.

Learn to deploy your code to servers, using services like Heroku or Amazon Web Services, to have your projects visible live. You can deploy applications that do not have a back-end or databases, applications such as a small set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, for free on Github via Github Pages.

**Front-end projects**
Find resources in [my docs](../docs) for help with front-end projects.

* At least a couple of from-scratch pages/sites/projects with your own HTML and CSS, and something making use of popular CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap.
* Something using a [CSS pre-processor](https://www.sitepoint.com/6-current-options-css-preprocessors/) like [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* A project using plain old JavaScript and something making asynchronous requests with JavaScript
* Something built with a JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Ember

**Back-end projects**
Find resources in [my docs](../docs) for help with back-end projects.

Here's a great [Quora question](https://www.quora.com/What-does-a-good-junior-backend-developer-portfolio-website-look-like) on best back-end projects.

* A couple projects built on web frameworks, such as Rails (Ruby), Node (JavaScript), .NET (C#) ...the list goes on.
* An API responding [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp), rather than HTML files
* A repository containing algorithm problems with your solutions, including comments to showcase your thinking process

So put together at least 4 projects you can talk about to other developers and during interviews, and iterate on them as you learn.

### Get ideas on stuff to build
Below are some places to get ideas on stuff to build yourself--but also remember that contributing to open source projects are one of the best ways to build your credibility as a programmer.
