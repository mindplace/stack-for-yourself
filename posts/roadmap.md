# Your Full Stack Roadmap

## Hello world!

You want to learn how to write code, maybe build web applications. Or you're already a developer and want to keep working on your skills. Awesome! These docs are an aggregation of resources from around the web to help you on your quest.

Many software engineers are self taught, and _all_ engineers have to learn how to teach themselves at some point in their early journey. **You can learn everything you need to know to be a developer without spending any money.** The catch is, you will need buckets of discipline.

## Learning to code is [hard](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard) and it's worth it!

What even is code? Read Paul Ford's animated ["What is Code?"](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) essay.

Don't give up! Your [first 100 hours](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/the-beginner-s-dilemma-your-first-100-hours-of-code) will probably be to be especially difficult: first you'll be on Codecademy or somewhere similar, getting the hang of variables and `puts` statements, and suddenly you'll find yourself trying to solve some sort of simple [algorithm](...) like [finding the nth Fibonacci number](https://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/recursion/find-nth-fibonacci-number), and everything will break and you'll get frustrated, cry, and believe you're not cut out for this.

Don't let this deter you. Keep at it and it will continue to make more and more sense. Make a plan, define your projects and your personal roadmap, reach out to others for help, direction, support, and community, and don't lose heart.

Trust that you _really are_ cut out for this. [People of all ages and walks of life are cut out for this](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/yes-im-56-and-learning-to-code-f33abea6fd4c#.1fo7o2wib) - your background means _nothing_. I personally hold 2 degrees in English literature and worked in HR/Compliance before deciding to pursue software engineering, and I couldn't be happier with my decision.

## The Roadmap

**First steps**

1. Getting yourself setup with your [tools](../tools.md).
2. Learn a [back-end language](../docs/languages.md)
3. Learn initial [computer science fundamendals](../docs/computer_science.md)
4. Learn about [algorithms](../docs/algorithms.md) and spend as much time possible practiting.
4. Learn about [databases](../databases.md) and build a few of your own.

**Next steps**

1. [Networking](../networking_and_requests.md): Learn how requests are made on the internet, where code lives, how servers listen for and respond to queries.
2. Learn about [HTML & CSS](../docs/front_end.md) and the basis of front-end computing.
3. Learn [JavaScript](../docs/javascript.md), the language that runs directly in front-end browsers.
4. Learn a modern framework such as [Rails](../docs/ruby.md) and create applications with both back-end and front-end elements interacting together.

**Last steps**

1. Build projects and prepare your [portfolio](../posts/building_dev_portfolios.md)
2. Learn what it's like to [work as a developer](../docs/working_as_a_developer.md) and start applying to jobs.

## Bootcamps

I really like the idea of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/09/how-startups-are-solving-a-decades-old-problem-in-education/">mastery learning</a>, which is when you learn or are taught a concept until you master it, before moving on to the next one. Ideally, you do it with the help of a mentor or community. If you do choose to go to a bootcamp, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-steps-get-most-out-coding-bootcamp-tom-goldenberg?trk=hp-feed-article-title-publish">get the most out of it</a>.

**Mentor-based bootcamps**

* [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io/web-developer-career-track): a paid bootcamp whose model is to connect you with a developer who acts as a mentor.
* [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com): similarly to Bloc.io, a paid bootcamp program connecting you to a mentor.

**Traditional bootcamps**

* [AppAcademy](https://www.appacademy.io/course/app-academy-open): probably the best one I know of.
* ...too many other great high-quality ones to list.
