**Prerequisite: [understand how the Internet works, how apps make and respond to requests, and other essential networks]({% post_url 2016-10-01-networking-basics %}).**

Ruby's [`open-uri`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/open-uri/rdoc/OpenURI.html) is a built-in library used to help make HTTP requests. Ruby's [`json`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html) module is also great to know for parsing JSON data into Ruby hashes.

To make an API request, you'd normally need an [API endpoint](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/endpoints.html). You make a request to that endpoint via a program or a script; when your program runs and your request is made, the response is recorded onto it.

Here's an example use of the `open-uri` and `json` libraries with an API endpoint. I decided to use one of [NYC's open data APIs](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/swhp-yxa4.json) to get information about open job positions listed on NYC's government sites.

Once I accessed the site, I went looking for the API endpoint URL:

![api-endpoint](/assets/img/endpoint.png)

Grabbing that, I opened up my empty `workspace.rb` file and wrote the following code:

```ruby
require 'open-uri'
require 'json'

# the URL is parsed as a URI
data_uri = URI.parse('https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/swhp-yxa4.json')

# the data is pulled down and opened as a file,
# information from the file is pulled into an array,
# array is joined up,
# and processed by the JSON library into a Ruby hash

data = JSON.parse(data_uri.open{|file| file.readlines }.join)

```

Here's a snippet of what the `data` variable now contains:

```

By the way, I explored these values and wrote this script with heavy involvement of the [`pry` gem](https://github.com/pry/pry), which lets you stop in the middle of your scripts to check out values.
