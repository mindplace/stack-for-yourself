# Hello world!

You want to learn how to program. Hopefully you want to learn to build web applications. Or you're already a developer and want to keep working on your skills. Awesome!

This site is an aggregation of resources from around the web to help you in your quest. Browse it, then come back when you're ready to jump into one of the topics more deeply.

You won't really find answers to your immediate questions here. Instead, you'll find resources to get deeper into all sorts of different topics. For example, if you want to learn about [CSS]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/01/01/front-end-part-1-html-css-dom/) and need resources to start, this is the right site for you. If you want to understand why `height: 100%` doesn't quite work the same way `width: 100%` seems to, StackOverflow is better.

## Learning to code can be [really hard](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard).

It's not just you who might feel that way. Don't give up.

Your [first 100 hours](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/the-beginner-s-dilemma-your-first-100-hours-of-code) will probably be to be especially difficult: first you'll be on Codecademy or somewhere similar, getting the hang of variables and `puts` statements, and suddenly you'll find yourself trying to solve some sort of simple [algorithm]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/09/01) like [finding the nth Fibonacci number](http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/recursion/find-nth-fibonacci-number/) and everything will break and you'll cry out of fear and frustration and because you'll remember that part of you believes you're not cut out for this.

But keep at it and it will continue to make more and more sense. [Organize yourself and your projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/01/01/managing-your-tools), stay on top of where you are in your plan, [reach out to others for help, direction, support, and community]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/01/01/coding-community), and don't lose heart.

## Your essential competencies--and your full-stack roadmap!

<img src="https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1409261668002.png" width="100%">

* Be able to type very well, quickly, and cleanly. Try [typing.io](https://typing.io/) to level up.
* Get very comfortable with the command line. Learn the heck out of git.
* Learn a back-end language that plays nice with the web, like Ruby, Python, Go, C#, JavaScript via Node.js, PHP, or Java. Don't let yourself get lost in the crazy comparison-mongering crowds that tell you that Ruby is dying or C# is too hard: every single one of these languages has an excellent history, great community of contributors and users, and makes huge buckets of cash for the companies that use them. Every one of these are great for web development for their own reasons.
* Learn the language you've chosen by solving small problems and graduating to more challenging ones. Create games for the console and write small programs, like [to-do lists](https://github.com/mindplace/nifty_things/tree/master/To_do_list) or the [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) game.
* Take a couple of free courses on fundamental computer science basics: check out Open [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-department/), iTunes University, or Coursera.
* Learn the basics of Object Oriented Design, TDD, Ruby and Rails on [rubyplus.com](https://rubyplus.com/articles). Keep upto date with [Rails screencasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/rails-screencast/id1142573687). 
* Drown in algorithms and data structures. Know your way around essential concepts like Object Oriented Programming. Everything you learn at this stage will only improve your grasp of the back-end language you've chosen.
* Learn how the web works, how requests are made, where code lives, how servers listen for and respond to queries.
* Learn a web framework for the back-end language you chose.
* Learn how to setup and use databases with your projects. Get really comfortable with SQL syntax.
* Be able to create simple pages with HTML and CSS.
* Learn JavaScript. No whining. Be able to write vanilla JavaScript both in the sense of objects and in the sense of DOM manipulations.
* Learn about the DOM and the way JavaScript interacts with HTML & CSS. While you're at it, learn jQuery.
* Choose a front-end JavaScript framework and learn it. Every current framework has a great community and support right now, so don't worry too much about choosing the 'wrong' one.
* Learn to deploy your code to servers, using services like Heroku or Amazon Web Services, to have your projects visible live.  
* Build projects to showcase every single aspect of your learning. Share all your best code on Github so others can see your portfolio and possibly even use the code you've written.
* Honestly, build as much as possible. Have ideas and work to make them happen.

# Other roadmaps

## Learning on your own
[Go from Zero to Programmer Hero in One Guide!](http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/learn-code/) But really there's a lot of [cool discussions](https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-designing-a-syllabus-to-take-a-newbie-like-me-from-a-coding-zero-to-a-Full-Stack-Web-Dev-Hero-in-6-months-and-under-1000-what-would-you-tell-me-to-learn-and-what-online-resources-should-I-use) about how to get into web development when you're a raw beginner to programming generally that are worth checking out.

* [Essential competencies for Rails development](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/this-is-why-learning-rails-is-hard?__s=uvtabrbrcctximf9dhin): Rails is the major web framework for Ruby, and a popular choice for building apps quickly and well.
* [Where to start learning Rails and general webdev concepts](http://www.unforgivableruby.com/post/114752678529/learning-web-developmentrails-without-spending)

* [TreeHouse, various small courses](https://teamtreehouse.com/)
* [KhanAcademy courses](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
* [Bento](https://bento.io/), cool tutorials for different web development technologies and concepts.
* [Learn the Hard Way courses](http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html), highly recommended.
* [Codeschool](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/): lots of great, interactive tutorials, especially geared towards raw beginners. Some of them are behind paywalls, but it's very reasonable pricing.
* [Videos at Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/)
* [More videos](http://videolectures.net/Top/Computer_Science/), computer science video lectures

* [Dreaming in Code](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/forum/78-programming-tutorials/): Lots of tutorials for different languages


## Learning with some help
I really like the idea of [mastery learning](http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/09/how-startups-are-solving-a-decades-old-problem-in-education/), which is when you learn or are taught a concept until you master it, before moving on to the next one. Ideally, you do it with the help of a mentor or community. Here's some places to do that:

* [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming): completely free, Ruby-based full-stack development program, with an amazing online community.
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/): superb, completely free program, teaching from the front-end backwards, with an excellent and huge community which in many cities has local presence. Actively maintained and being expanded to include new courses such as one teaching D3.js.
* [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io/web-developer-career-track): a paid bootcamp whose model is to connect you with a developer who acts as a mentor.
* [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/): similarly to Bloc.io, a paid bootcamp program connecting you to a mentor.

In general, if you choose to go to a bootcamp, [get the most out of it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-steps-get-most-out-coding-bootcamp-tom-goldenberg?trk=hp-feed-article-title-publish).

## You need to know a variety of things to be a developer...
...and all of these things are continually changing. But you'll survive. And then, you'll thrive.

* *[Apprenticeship Patterns](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html)*: this awesome book is  free online!
* [Level up as a dev](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-level-up-as-a-developer-87344584777c#.2x5iu4n2i), great article.
