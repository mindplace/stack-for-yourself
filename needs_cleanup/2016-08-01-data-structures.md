## Start here
Remember that data structures go hand in hand with [algorithms]({% post_url 2016-09-01-algorithms-uncategorized %}).

### Foundational concepts
* [Binary search](https://fluxusfrequency.github.io/blog/2014/01/31/building-a-binary-search/)
* [Quick and dirty intro to Big O notation](https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/a-rubyist-s-guide-to-big-o-notation/)
* [Big O notation cheat sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

### Sorting algorithms
* [Sorting algorithms animations](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms), a fantastic place to start learning about different kinds of sorting algorithms.
* [Writing different sorts as algorithms](https://www.nczonline.net/blog/tag/algorithms/)

### Trees
