    I'm Esther! I usually use 'full stack web developer' to describe what I do on a day-to-day basis,
    but it's easier to say that I'm simply a curious person who likes to stick my nose where I have
    no business sticking it. I love coding, get excited about web development, and love sharing what
    I know with others.

    I'm [elsewhere on the internet](https://estherleytush.com/), and I would love to hear from you about
    your web development journey.
