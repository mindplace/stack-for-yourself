## Start here
Regardless of whether you're positioning yourself as front-end, back-end, full-stack, QA, or what-have-you...you need projects that showcase those skills.

As a **front-end** developer, for example, you would make sure your Github repositories contain the following:

* At least a couple of from-scratch pages/sites/projects with [your own HTML&CSS]({% post_url 2016-06-01-front-end-part-1-html-css-dom %})
* Something using a [CSS pre-processor](https://www.sitepoint.com/6-current-options-css-preprocessors/) like [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* A project using [plain JavaScript and something using jQuery and Ajax]({% post_url 2016-06-01-javascript-uncategorized %})
* Something built with a [JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Ember]( {% post_url 2016-06-01-front-end-frameworks %})
* Several somethings that make use of [non-JS frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, Jekyll, etc.]({% post_url 2016-06-01-front-end-frameworks %})

A **back-end** developer would probably spend less time building front-end projects like those that fit above's list. [Here's a great Quora question/answers on this](https://www.quora.com/What-does-a-good-junior-backend-developer-portfolio-website-look-like). For them, a good list could include:

* A couple projects built on web frameworks, like [Rails (Ruby's main web framework)]({% post_url 2016-07-01-ruby-rails %}), or [Node (JavaScript for the back-end)]({% post_url 2016-06-01-front-end-frameworks %}), or [.NET (C#'s web framework)](https://www.microsoft.com/net)...the list goes on.
* At least one of those should be built to deliver info via something like [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp), rather than views: in short, built to be an [API]({% post_url 2016-05-01-open-apis %})
* A repository containing [algorithm problems with your solutions]({% post_url 2016-09-01-algorithms-uncategorized %}), with plenty of comments to showcase your thinking process

So put together at least 10 projects you can talk about to other developers and during interviews, and iterate on them as you learn.

### Get ideas on stuff to build
Below are some places to get ideas on stuff to build yourself--but also remember that [contributing to open source projects]({% post_url 2016-05-01-contributing-to-open-source %}) are one of the best ideas you can have if you want to build up your credibility as a programmer.
