## Start here
Algorithms are small problems to solve with code, sometimes requiring cleverness, often requiring loops, and even more often requiring different kinds of [data structures]({% post_url 2016-08-01-data-structures %}) to solve, such as [arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_arrays.htm) and [hashes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_hashes.htm) to name a few. They are very commonly used as [interview questions]({% post_url 2016-05-01-seeking-dev-work %}).

Remember that algorithms go hand in hand with [data structures]({% post_url 2016-08-01-data-structures %}).
