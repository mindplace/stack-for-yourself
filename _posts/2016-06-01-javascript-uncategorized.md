## Start here

JavaScript has been around a pretty good long time, and has been getting much better over time. Because it's the only dynamic programming language supported by most browsers, it's an essential language for web development. It was named JavaScript to take advantage of Java's popularity at the time, although it is in no way at all related to Java. Later it was renamed EcmaScript, but colloquially it's still called JavaScript. [These talks covering a ton of JavaScript topics](https://talks.devbootcamp.com/?s=JavaScript) are a good place to start.

ES6 has just come out, bringing with it a lot of changes to syntax and execution, most of them very timely. Check out this [ES6 cheatsheet](https://es6cheatsheet.com/) which acts as a good intro to changes from ES5.

## Build tools, task runners, and important supporting tools
Don't [flounder among the many build tools and task runners out there](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/making-sense-of-front-end-build-tools-3a1b3a87043b#.aqjw9cj0q). You do ned at least one or two of them in your workflow, so get familiar with these big ones.

* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): this is a JavaScript task-runner, able to do tasks like compile SASS, compress images, and more.
* [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Another JavaScript task-runner **(my favorite!)**, with syntax that's different from gulp.
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/build-tools), Node Package Manager: a software package manager for JavaScript.
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), another very popular and new package manager for JavaScript.
* [Bower](https://bower.io/): another very popular package manager.
* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/): a scaffolding tool helping you kickstart your new projects.
* [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/): a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs, then packages all of those modules into a small number of bundles (often only one) to be loaded by the browser. [webpack documentation is here.](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). To get started, [take the webpack course](https://webpack.academy/p/the-core-concepts) that the creator of webpack made.
* [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) and/or [Redux](http://redux.js.org/): these are tools that manage front-end application state and storage. [Here's an article discussing the two](https://blog.andyet.com/2015/08/06/what-the-flux-lets-redux/).

## Great libraries to know

### jQuery
jQuery is incredibly popular ([over 70% of all sites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery/all/all) use it), but [you might not need it](https://github.com/oneuijs/You-Dont-Need-jQuery), and your project may be better off without it.

* [Introduction to jQuery](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/mystery-jquery-object-syntax-basic-introduction/)
* [Official documentation](http://api.jquery.com/), and a very good one too
* [Events documentation](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/)
* [Creating tabs with jQuery](http://www.mkyong.com/jquery/how-to-use-css-and-jquery-to-hide-and-show-tab-content/)
* ["I still love jQuery -- and you should, too."](https://hackernoon.com/i-still-love-jquery-and-you-should-too-3114f33f249e)

### Data visualization libraries
* [D3 data visualization](https://github.com/d3/d3), the go-to library for data visualization with JavaScript. Also check out these [D3 code snippets](https://bl.ocks.org/) to get started. There's plenty of [other JavaScript libraries for data visualization](http://www.sitepoint.com/twelve-javascript-libraries-data-visualization/) out there as well.
* [Google Visualizations](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference#development-tip)


### Other libraries to know
* [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/): A great library for date and time that comes with a ton of useful date and time functions. This is definitely a production-level library.
* [GMaps](https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps), free wrapper to use the Google Maps API.
* [Parallax.js](http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/), super simple library allowing you to create a parallax scrolling effect on images.
* [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html) promises: a very useful, production-level library making it easy to make and use asynchronous promises in JavaScript.
* [Lodash.js](https://lodash.com/): Great library that dramatically extends basic array, collection, etc functionality so you don't have to write your own every time. Production-level library that's widely used.

## Free stuff
Lots of people give away small bits of code for free. This is a super amazing place to start looking at that stuff: [Codyhouse](https://codyhouse.co/), a place for free tiny JS, HTML & CSS things.

* [OWL Carousel](http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/index.html), a super cute and super nifty carousel element that works nicely off of jQuery.
* [Draft.js](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/docs/overview.html#content): A rich text editor for the browser, developed by Facebook.
