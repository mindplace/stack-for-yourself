## Start here

JavaScript has been around a pretty good long time, and has been getting much better over time. Because it's the only dynamic programming language supported by most browsers, it's an essential language for web development. It was named JavaScript to take advantage of Java's popularity at the time, although it is in no way at all related to Java. Later it was renamed EcmaScript, but colloquially it's still called JavaScript. [These talks covering a ton of JavaScript topics](https://talks.devbootcamp.com/?s=JavaScript) are a good place to start.

ES6 has just come out, bringing with it a lot of changes to syntax and execution, most of them very timely. Check out this [ES6 cheatsheet](https://es6cheatsheet.com/) which acts as a good intro to changes from ES5.

## Great libraries to know

### jQuery
* [Introduction to jQuery](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/mystery-jquery-object-syntax-basic-introduction/)
* [Official documentation](http://api.jquery.com/), and a very good one too
* [Events documentation](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/)
* [Creating tabs with jQuery](http://www.mkyong.com/jquery/how-to-use-css-and-jquery-to-hide-and-show-tab-content/)

### Lodash.js
Great library that dramatically extends basic array, collection, etc functionality so you don't have to write your own every time. Production-level library that's widely used.

* [Main page](https://lodash.com/)

### data visualization libraries
* [D3 data visualization](https://github.com/d3/d3), the go-to library for data visualization with JavaScript. Also check out these [D3 code snippets](https://bl.ocks.org/) to get started. There's plenty of [other JavaScript libraries for data visualization](http://www.sitepoint.com/twelve-javascript-libraries-data-visualization/) out there as well.
* [Google Visualizations](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference#development-tip)

### Moment.js
* [A great library for date and time](http://momentJavaScript.com/): comes with a ton of useful date and time functions

### More
* [GMaps](https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps), free wrapper to use the Google Maps API.
* [Parallax.js](http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/), super simple library allowing you to create a parallax scrolling effect on images.
* [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html) promises: a very useful, production-level library making it easy to make and use asynchronous promises in JavaScript.

## Free stuff
Lots of people give away small bits of code for free. This is a super amazing place to start looking at that stuff: [Codyhouse](https://codyhouse.co/), a place for free tiny JS, HTML & CSS things.
