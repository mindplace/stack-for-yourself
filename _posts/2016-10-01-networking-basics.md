## Start here

Read Mozilla's great introduction to [how the Internet works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work).

Also, check out this [animated guide to how the internet works](https://internet.frontier.com/how-the-internet-works/).

### Internet basics

* [HTTP Basics](http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/http_basics.html), a thorough primer on HTTP.
* What's a web server? [This will tell you.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server)
* [Understanding status codes with Status Cats](https://http.cat/): every HTTP request has a response that is accompanied by a status code like `200 OK` or `500 Internal Server Error`, and these lovely felines can help you remember them.
* In order to understand how servers work, [build a simple server script](http://www.blackbytes.info/2016/08/build-your-own-web-server/) with Ruby.
* Understanding what [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) is.
* Understanding [HTTP methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
* Understanding what [APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API) are.

### Ajax requests

Ajax is a way of making a request to get resources with JavaScript, without reloading or refreshing or redirecting the page. Meaning, it can happen in the background, then update a specific part of the page. This is the concept behind web applications, where interaction with a page--clicking or selecting things, etc--doesn't force your page to reload, but merely updates that particular part of it.

* Understanding the [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started) request.
* [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX) documentation.
* Understanding how [CORS](https://zinoui.com/blog/cross-domain-ajax-request) work, cross-domain ajax requests. It's the concept where the front-end request (JavaScript) isn't itself officially connected to the server-side application where the data being requested lives. Read about [how jQuery and Node interact during a CORS request](https://www.bennadel.com/blog/2327-cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors-ajax-requests-between-jquery-and-node-js.htm).

### Web frameworks

* Connect a front-end application with a separately-hosted back-end application: this keeps your concerns separate. The alternative is building HTML views with your back-end application or trying to integrate a front-end application onto a back-end application, and it can easily turn into spaghetti code. Here's an example of the separated elements: [building an Angular2 / Rails 5 website and deploying to Heroku](http://angularonrails.wpengine.com/deploy-angular-2rails-5-app-heroku/), where the front-end is separated out from the back-end. Oh, and if you're not convinced, read [this article on why client-side rendering is a good idea](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/rapid-development-via-mock-apis-e559087be066#.ntlx09c0v). (That means when HTML pages are generated by client computers, rather than created in a back-end app and sent forward to the client.)

### Understanding Caches and Caching
Let's say I have a computer and I request to view the website "helloworld.com". The server returns to me several files: an HTML index file, a stylesheet, and several images that the HTML file needs.

Now, let's say that tomorrow, I ask again for these files by making a request to load "helloworld.com". In the interim, no changes have been made on the server to those files. So, in order to conserve time and not re-request files that are unchanged, my computer simply re-loads the files it already received for this website, after checking that those files aren't supposed to be expired.

This process of not re-requesting files is called cacheing, and most modern browsers do this. It's an effective way of speeding up the loading of a website, but there immediately arises a need to manipulate these caches, for a variety of reasons.

### Registering your domain and understanding DNS

* Amazon Web Services is one of the places you can purchase and maintain a domain (a URL). Here's their [welcome packet](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html), and their [guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar.html) to registering your domain through Amazon Web Services.
