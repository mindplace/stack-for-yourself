## Start here
Local events and meetups are great ways to get involved with other developers, learn, contribute, and make connections. Don't wait until you are ready to look for work: let it be a part of what it means for you to become a web developer in the first place.

### Podcasts
Listening to technical and tech-light podcasts are a great way to ease yourself into the coding community. Check out these good ones:

### Local communities
Find your local techies via [Meetup](meetup.com) groups and [Eventbrite events](eventbrite.com). These often take the form of workshops or classes, which is a great way to level up your skillset.

### Hackathons
Hackathons are great for collaborating with other developers in an intense way to build brand new projects from the ground up.
