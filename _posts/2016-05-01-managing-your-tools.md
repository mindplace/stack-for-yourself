## Start here
Make sure you [get the right tools installed on your computer](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/installfest) to start developing for the web (still applicable if you aren't going to use Rails).

#### Your most essential tools:
* A grasp of how to use [git and Github]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/05/01/contributing-to-open-source)
* A text-editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/), Github's project, or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), probably the most popular

And take the time to read this great essay on the [maker's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), by Paul Graham of [Y-Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).

### Vim
An important text editor (like those mentioned above) but one that is meant to be navigated with only a keyboard. It has a steep learning curve, but it's really worth it to be able to edit and type in files at the speed of thought. Your computer already has it installed! That said, treat yourself to a better version via [MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) (which supports non-Mac computers as well).
