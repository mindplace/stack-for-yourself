## Start here
Open source contributions are basically when people share code they've written with others, who can use that code for free (although [licensing has an effect on what you can do with open source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses)). This project is open source, for example. It's what makes it possible for you to take a copy of this project, make some changes, and request that those changes be merged into the main project branch. (Contributions are really welcomed! Find out more about that on [the project's Github page.](https://github.com/mindplace/stack-for-yourself#contributing))

This site itself is written on technologies that are open-sourced, [Ruby]({% post_url 2016-07-01-ruby-overview %}) and [Jekyll]({% post_url 2016-06-01-front-end-part-3-non-js-frameworks %}) to name a few. So open source code is a way to contribute to the world's codebase as well as a way to showcase your work.

Open source contributions tend to take the form of contributing your work to projects that are already available, but you can also write code for other people to use, for example making a [Ruby gem]({% post_url 2016-07-01-ruby-gems %}).

Girl Develop It put together a great presentation on the topic, [get the PDF here]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/girl-develop-it-oss.pdf).

An essential element of open source contributions is [a grasp of git and Github]({% post_url 2016-05-01-github %}).

### Find projects to contribute to
You can [figure out where software is needed](https://medium.com/making-lost-my-name/the-scent-of-software-3bba0d9ab36e#.alat0k7z7) that you can then build, especially if you work around others.

* [Github projects, bugs, and feature requests tagged with beginner-friendly labels](https://github.com/lucev/beginner-friendly) so you can start contributing right away as a beginner.
* [CodeTriage](http://www.codetriage.com/)
* [CodeForAmerica](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), check out their volunteer/code wanted section [here](https://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues).
* [CodeMontage](https://www.codemontage.com/)
* [UpForGrabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/)

### Start your own projects for others to contribute to
You can use tools others have built, such as [open source APIs]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/05/01/open-apis), to create new awesome things. Find more ideas and [build your own portfolio of work]({% post_url 2016-05-01-portfolio %}).
