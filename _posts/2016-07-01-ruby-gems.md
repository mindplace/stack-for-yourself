## Start here
Ruby gems are modular libraries that are meant to be sort of plug-and-play for Ruby projects and apps. Many are meant for or compatible with Rails.

Check out [Awesome Ruby](https://ruby.libhunt.com/) which shows different gems in groups and compares them (since many gems are out there to support the same features).

### Building your own
* [RailsCasts: build a new gem with bundler](http://railscasts.com/episodes/245-new-gem-with-bundler), probably the easiest way to get started
* [RubyGems](http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/)'s own guide and documentation for building a new gem. (That's the site that aggregates them and from where you download gems via the `gem install [gem_name]` command.)

<hr>

## Especially good to know
* [pry](https://github.com/pry/pry), possibly the best Ruby debugger tool out there right now.
* [unirest](http://unirest.io/ruby), helping you make very clean http requests without the headache of [Net::HTTP](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html) syntax, and as an alternative to [HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty)

### A general list
* [emittr](https://github.com/talyssonoc/emittr), an event listener.
* [github_api](https://github.com/piotrmurach/github) gem, a Ruby wrapper for making requests to the official Github API.
* [soda-ruby](https://github.com/socrata/soda-ruby), a gem to parse Government Open Data.
* [destroyed_at](https://github.com/DockYard/ruby-destroyed_at): adds awesome functionality for a Rails app; instead of actually destroying a record of something, it's instead marked as destroyed, so you can restore it if needed.
* [materialize-sass](https://github.com/mkhairi/materialize-sass), Google's [Materialize]({% post_url 2016-06-01-front-end-part-3-non-js-frameworks%}) CSS framework in SASS format.
* [google_visualr](https://github.com/winston/google_visualr): "A Ruby Gem for the Google Visualization API. Write Ruby code. Generate Javascript. Display a Google Chart."
