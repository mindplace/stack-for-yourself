## Start here
Check out our [guide to installing Ruby on your local computer]({% post_url 2017-01-18-getting-started-with-ruby-on-a-mac %}).

Check out [Team Treehouse's list of Ruby projects](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/coolest-ruby-projects-ever). Ruby is written in C, and you can look at [its source code on Github](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/) because it's an open source language, which is how you're able to learn it for free. Also, there's a project to
[write a Ruby compiler in Ruby](https://hokstad.com/compiler) as part of a fun effort to write Ruby in Ruby (as opposed to C).

Definitely take a look at the [Ruby core object model](https://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/5152080) to get a sense for how it organizes itself.

Probably the best reason to learn Ruby is to be able to build things on/for the web and have a lot of fun while doing it. So check out [Rails]({% post_url 2016-07-01-ruby-rails %}) and other [Ruby frameworks]({% post_url 2016-07-01-ruby-frameworks %}) for building with
Ruby on the web.
