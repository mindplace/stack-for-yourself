## Start here

**Prerequisite: [understand how the Internet works, how apps make and respond to requests, and other essential networks]({% post_url 2016-10-01-networking-basics %}).**

Rails powers some very cool sites online, like [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/), [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/), [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/), [Github](https://github.com/), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)... and on and on. Ruby, especially on Rails, has a tremendous amount of power for building and deploying quickly, making it especially popular among startups.

Use [Kaffeine](https://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/) if you are hosting your site on Heroku and don't wait it to sleep at the wrong times!

Get clarity on your RESTful routes with [Restular](http://www.restular.com/) (but keep in mind that its actual syntax is meant more for [Sinatra]({% post_url 2016-07-01-ruby-frameworks %})).

[Here are the different areas you need to be competent in](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/this-is-why-learning-rails-is-hard?__s=uvtabrbrcctximf9dhin) in order to work with Rails. It's a great high-level but concise overview.
