## Start here

Read this to get started understanding the front-end context: ["The Front-Ender's Guide to the Galaxy"](https://hackernoon.com/a-frontenders-guide-to-the-galaxy-pt-i-ii-3ae2f85d4a01).

There's quite a lot of JavaScript frameworks to choose from! Here's an [article to help you decide which one](https://www.sitepoint.com/top-javascript-frameworks-libraries-tools-use/) you're going to learn. Here's another one discussing [the top current frameworks and topics to learn](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-topics-to-learn-in-2017-700a397b711).

Check out this great roadmap: ["From Zero to Front-end Hero, Part 2"](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-2-adfa4824da9b#.jipjenhuj) ([Part 1](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-1-7d4f7f0bff02#.sb4dij3lx) is for HTML & CSS).

**"What JavaScript framework should I learn?"**

React, developed by Facebook, is [coming out on the very top](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/angular-2-versus-react-there-will-be-blood-66595faafd51#.275mvwu8w).

Learning JavaScript in today's world can be [pretty messy](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.yufaj0qrc), and even experienced developers can find themselves at a loss in this new JavaScript ecosystem.

### Node.js
Not actually a framework, it's basically JavaScript on the back-end. Node.js plus [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is the beginning of a beautiful back-end app!

* [Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
* [Node status](http://status.npmjs.org/): great site if you're precompiling and something goes wrong with downloading Node.

* [*Node.js Beginner*](http://www.nodebeginner.org/) book
* [*Node.js In Action*](https://www.manning.com/books/node-js-in-action)
* Get started with [installing Node on your computer](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). You can also [use a package manager that your computer already uses](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to download and install Node.
* Learn more about Node [from one of the developers who built it at Google](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/an-interview-with-matt-loring-an-engineer-on-googles-nodejs-runtime-team-3de1adddffdd)
