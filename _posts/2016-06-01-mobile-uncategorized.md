## Start here
If you want to build properly for mobile--that is, build iOS and/or Android applications, you'll need to use the right languages and tools for the job. Android applications are built on [Java](http://code.tutsplus.com/series/learn-java-for-android-development--mobile-22888). iOS applications are built on [Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) or [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), using [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ide/).
