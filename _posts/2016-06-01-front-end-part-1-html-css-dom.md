## Start here

By far, your most important front-end tool is the [Chrome developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) that come built-in with the Chrome browser. Absolutely explore and learn these tools as you will need complete fluency in order to build HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

Start with this great roadmap: ["From Zero to Front-end Hero, Part 1"](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-1-7d4f7f0bff02#.sb4dij3lx). ([Part 2 is for JavaScript](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-2-adfa4824da9b#.jipjenhuj).)

Mozilla Developer Network generally puts out spectacular content for understanding front-end technologies. For example, check out their [HTML introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction).

Check out these [101 tips for front-end](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/101-ways-to-make-your-website-more-awesome-79c934dd2a11#.5yci2z37b), a really great collection of suggestions for improving your front-end code.

Try out [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), a free online tool allowing you to run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to see output.
