## Start here
Note that the standard `bash`/`shell`/`CLI`/`command line interface` comes in large part from a history of Unix computing. Mac computers are Unix-based, so the syntax is in large part the same. But Windows computers do not have a Unix base, although very recently they have started to natively run Linux kernels (which is very cool: Linux is a descendant of Unix in a similar way to the Mac OS). To use command-line functionality on a Windows computer, download [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). Read a bit more about these issues re: Unix, Mac, and Windows in [this Quora question](https://www.quora.com/If-Mac-OS-X-and-Linux-are-based-on-Unix-then-what-is-Windows-based-on-and-why-was-it-implemented-like-this-by-Bill-Gates).

The terms *command line*, *command-line*, *command line interface (CLI)*, *terminal*, *shell*, and *bash* all mean the same thing: a text-based interface to your computer where you can run [bash](http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/bash/) code.
