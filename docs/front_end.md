# HTML & CSS

By far, your most important front-end tool is the [Chrome developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) that come built-in with the Chrome browser. Absolutely explore and learn these tools as you will need complete fluency in order to build HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

Start with this great roadmap: ["From Zero to Front-end Hero, Part 1"](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-1-7d4f7f0bff02#.sb4dij3lx). ([Part 2 is for JavaScript](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-2-adfa4824da9b#.jipjenhuj).)

Mozilla Developer Network generally puts out spectacular content for understanding front-end technologies. For example, check out their [HTML introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction).

Check out these [101 tips for front-end](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/101-ways-to-make-your-website-more-awesome-79c934dd2a11#.5yci2z37b), a really great collection of suggestions for improving your front-end code.

Try out [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), a free online tool allowing you to run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to see output.

# Front-end JavaScript frameworks

Read this to get started understanding the front-end context: ["The Front-Ender's Guide to the Galaxy"](https://hackernoon.com/a-frontenders-guide-to-the-galaxy-pt-i-ii-3ae2f85d4a01).

There's quite a lot of JavaScript frameworks to choose from! Here's an [article to help you decide which one](https://www.sitepoint.com/top-javascript-frameworks-libraries-tools-use/) you're going to learn. Here's another one discussing [the top current frameworks and topics to learn](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-topics-to-learn-in-2017-700a397b711).

Check out this great roadmap: ["From Zero to Front-end Hero, Part 2"](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-2-adfa4824da9b#.jipjenhuj) ([Part 1](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-1-7d4f7f0bff02#.sb4dij3lx) is for HTML & CSS).

**"What JavaScript framework should I learn?"**

React, developed by Facebook, is [coming out on the very top](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/angular-2-versus-react-there-will-be-blood-66595faafd51#.275mvwu8w).

Learning JavaScript in today's world can be [pretty messy](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.yufaj0qrc), and even experienced developers can find themselves at a loss in this new JavaScript ecosystem.
