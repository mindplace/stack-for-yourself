# Algorithms
Algorithms are small, self-contained code solutions written to solve specific problems. An algorithm takes some data and manipulates or analyzes it in some way to produce some result. Sometimes they require cleverness, often require loops, and even more often require different kinds of data structures to solve. Algorithms are very commonly used as interview questions.

# Data structures

* [Arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_arrays.htm)
* [Dictionaries](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_hashes.htm), also called 'hashes' in Ruby and 'objects' in JavaScript.

### Foundational concepts
* [Binary search](https://fluxusfrequency.github.io/blog/2014/01/31/building-a-binary-search/)
* [Quick and dirty intro to Big O notation](https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/a-rubyist-s-guide-to-big-o-notation/)
* [Big O notation cheat sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

### Sorting algorithms
* [Sorting algorithms animations](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms), a fantastic place to start learning about different kinds of sorting algorithms.
* [Writing different sorts as algorithms](https://www.nczonline.net/blog/tag/algorithms/)
