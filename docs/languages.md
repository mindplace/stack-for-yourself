# Languages

Check out [RosettaCode](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code), a place to see different languages solving the same problems: helps you get a sense of how languages differ in their syntax and philosophies.

Plenty of people suggest you have a systematic approach to learning a new language. [Here is one such suggested plan](https://gist.github.com/CristhianMotoche/85c4f6cdafc23ee92df0bb6ff65ab1be) and I think if you can do all or most of this list with a language of your choosing then you are definitely at the level of being paid to write code. And also to be my hero.

That being said, languages can be [kind of ridiculous](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat). :)

## Different Languages
If you're trying to check on different syntax concepts in various languages, [SyntaxDB](https://syntaxdb.com/) is a truly incredible resource, and you can [read more about SyntaxDB here](https://flipboard.com/@flipboard/flip.it%2Fjqyeaj-a-search-engine-for-programming-languag/f-82bfd6ad31%2Fvice.com).

### Go
A very very cool language developed by Google and currently taking off. Based on the concept of multithreading: opens up new threads to handle new processes and deliver results incredibly quickly.

### Python

### C
C is a powerful language that gives programmers the opportunity to exact wide control over their code and programs. It's incredibly fast, and many other languages, like Ruby, are actually written in it.

### Crystal
"Fast like C, slick like Ruby": Ruby-like syntax but incredibly fast.

* [Documentation](https://crystal-lang.org/)
