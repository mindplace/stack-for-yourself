# Tools

Being able to use text editors and command-line interfaces to write and run code. Being able to use a computer to run your code, understanding the concept of the environment, being able to navigate text editors to write code.

* Be able to type very well, quickly, and cleanly. Try <a href="https://typing.io">typing.io</a> to level up.
* Choose and download a text editor
* You'll need to learn how to use <a href="/comp-sci/2016/10/01/command-line/">command line interfaces</a>. Terminal, bash/shell, Cygwin, and various other programs will allow you to have a textual interface to your computer, an essential part of writing code.
* Make sure you [get the right tools installed on your computer](https://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/installfest) to start developing for the web (still applicable if you aren't going to use Rails).

**Your most essential tools**  
* A text-editor (some options below)
* A good web browser (some options below)
* A grasp of how to use [git and Github](./git_and_github.md)

### Text editors
These are programs inside of which you'll be writing into and saving code files. You will need to download one in order to write code, even if you make an account with one of the free online code editors below.

* [repl.it](https://repl.it/): a beautiful, simple code editor that you can use online, free, to run code in a variety of languages, such as Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc.
* [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), a free online tool allowing you to run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to see output.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a text editor built by Github (and my go-to!).=
  * Atom's [official documentation and resources](https://atom.io/docs)
  * Atom [shortcuts](https://github.com/nwinkler/atom-keyboard-shortcuts)
  * [Packages](https://atom.io/packages), or add-ons that you can download to make Atom even more awesome.
* [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is probably the most popular text editor.
  * Sublime's [official documentation and resources](https://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/)
  * Sublime [shortcuts](https://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_osx.html)
  * [PackageControl](https://packagecontrol.io/) for Sublime, add-ons that you can download to make Sublime even more useful.
* vim - An important text editor but one that can only be navigated with keyboard shortcuts, so it has a steep learning curve. But it's really worth it to be able to create and edit files at the speed of thought. If you're on a Mac or Linux OS, your computer already has it installed! That said, treat yourself to a better version via [MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) (which supports non-Mac computers as well).
