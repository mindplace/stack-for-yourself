# git & Github

### git

git is a [command-line](...) tool that lets you create a history of project changes and make it possible to easily make project versions so you can try out different things before deciding on a final version. It also allows you to transverse this history of your project, making branches to add features or fix bugs while the master branch retains the cleanest and best working copy of your code.

### Github

[Github](https://github.com) allows you to share git repositories and contribute to the git repositories of other people. A vast number of companies (all of mine included) keep 100% of their code on Github in order to make it possible for their engineers to collaborate on their apps.
