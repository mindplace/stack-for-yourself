# Looking for work

Before you do anything else, connect with the tech community, especially locally. Most jobs aren't posted, and developer jobs are no different. You need to know people who know about jobs in their network, and who would recommend you into those roles.

* [Negotiating job offers](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer-ee17cccbdab6#.wh6xk26pl): a brilliant mindset and information.
* [Negotiating your salary](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/): understanding how to carry out a salary negotiation and what context your negotiation partner is coming from.
* Half, if not more, of the skills you need are soft skills. Here's a [fantastic guide on how to prepare for the soft-skills part of a developer interview](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-soft-skills-a8a5fb02c466).
* Put together your [portfolio](../posts/building_dev_portfolios.md).

## Searching for work after coding bootcamp
As an inexperienced developer, you'll be at a disadvantage...but you [can still land a job. It's just harder](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2016/09/12/software-development-job-without-experience/).

[This](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-resources-nyc-startup-jobs-will-blaze?trk=prof-post) is a great place to look for start-up jobs. Why start-ups? Because they're more willing to take risks, which means hiring untried developers...and because there's so much work to be done that you'll have no choice but to grab hold with both hands.

[This](https://clutchtalent.github.io/beginning-job-search/) is an amazing thoughtful guide to getting your first job after bootcamp or a self-taught program.

# Working as a developer

Always work to level up your ability to write better software.

Good code design is paramount these days for good software that creates value for users--that is, software that is good and enjoyable to use. I suggest that to that end, a good definition for 'good design' is, *good design is when a creator makes thoughtful decisions by taking into account everything that reasonably impacts their target/known user base*. There's nothing frou-frou or easy about good design, nor is it primarily concerned with how things look. It's a fundamental approach that needs to affect every aspect of your software.

# Contribute to open source

Open source contributions are basically when people share code they've written with others, who can use that code for free (although [licensing has an effect on what you can do with open source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses)). This project is open source, for example. It's what makes it possible for you to take a copy of this project, make some changes, and request that those changes be merged into the main project branch.

[Opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/) is a great series of guides to helping you get started with open source, whether as a creator or a contributor.

Open source contributions tend to take the form of contributing your work to projects that are already available, but you can also write code for other people to use, for example making Ruby gems.

Girl Develop It put together a great presentation on the topic, [get the PDF here](../assets/girl-develop-it-oss.pdf).

An essential element of open source contributions is [a grasp of git and Github](./git_and_github.md).

### Find projects to contribute to

* [figure out where software is needed](https://medium.com/making-lost-my-name/the-scent-of-software-3bba0d9ab36e#.alat0k7z7)
* [Github projects, bugs, and feature requests tagged with beginner-friendly labels](https://github.com/lucev/beginner-friendly) so you can start contributing right away as a beginner.
* [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
* [CodeForAmerica](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), check out their volunteer/code wanted section [here](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues).

### Agile: managing development
What is Agile? It's a way of working in teams, permitting you to be more, well, agile. The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) is the basis for this concept. Agile is wildly popular among development teams, and used extremely widely, so it's a good idea to understand what working within an Agile environment is like.
