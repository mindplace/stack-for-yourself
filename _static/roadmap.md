# Your Full Stack Roadmap

<hr>

## Hello world!

You want to learn how to program. Hopefully you want to learn to build web applications. Or you're already a developer and want to keep working on your skills. Awesome!

This site is an aggregation of resources from around the web to help you in your quest. Browse it, then come back when you're ready to jump into one of the topics more deeply.

You won't really find answers to your immediate questions here. Instead, you'll find resources to get deeper into all sorts of different topics. For example, if you want to learn about [CSS]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/01/01/front-end-part-1-html-css-dom/) and need resources to start, this is the right site for you. If you want to understand why `height: 100%` doesn't quite work the same way `width: 100%` seems to, StackOverflow is better.

## Learning to code can be [really hard](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard).

It's not just you who might feel that way. Don't give up.

Your [first 100 hours](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/the-beginner-s-dilemma-your-first-100-hours-of-code) will probably be to be especially difficult: first you'll be on Codecademy or somewhere similar, getting the hang of variables and `puts` statements, and suddenly you'll find yourself trying to solve some sort of simple [algorithm]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/09/01) like [finding the nth Fibonacci number](http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/recursion/find-nth-fibonacci-number/) and everything will break and you'll get frustrated and cry and feel fear and believe you're not cut out for this.

Don't let this deter you. Keep at it and it will continue to make more and more sense. [Organize yourself and your projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/01/01/managing-your-tools), stay on top of where you are in your plan, [reach out to others for help, direction, support, and community]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/01/01/coding-community), and don't lose heart.

## Your essential competencies--and your full-stack roadmap!

<img src="https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1409261668002.png" width="100%">

* Be able to type very well, quickly, and cleanly. Try [typing.io](https://typing.io/) to level up.
* Get very comfortable with the command line. Learn the heck out of git.
* Learn a back-end language that plays nice with the web, like Ruby, Python, Go, C#, JavaScript via Node.js, PHP, or Java. Don't let yourself get lost in the crazy comparison-mongering crowds that tell you that Ruby is dying or Java is too hard: every single one of these languages has an excellent history, great community of contributors and users, and makes huge buckets of cash for the companies that use them. Every one of these are great for web development for their own reasons.
* Learn the language you've chosen by solving small problems/algorithms and then graduating to more challenging ones. Create games for the console and write small programs, like [to-do lists](https://github.com/mindplace/nifty_things/tree/master/To_do_list) or the [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) game.
* Take a couple of courses on [fundamental computer science concepts]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/10/01/general-uncategorized).
* Drown in algorithms and data structures. Know your way around essential concepts like Object Oriented Programming. Everything you learn at this stage will only improve your grasp of the back-end language you've chosen.
* Learn how the web works, how requests are made, where code lives, how servers listen for and respond to queries.
* Learn a web framework for the back-end language you chose.
* Learn how to setup and use databases with your projects. Get really comfortable with SQL syntax.
* Be able to create simple pages with HTML and CSS.
* Learn JavaScript. Be able to write vanilla JavaScript both in the sense of objects and in the sense of DOM manipulations.
* Learn about the DOM and the way JavaScript interacts with HTML & CSS. Do this by learning jQuery.
* Choose a front-end JavaScript framework and learn it. Every modern framework has a great community and support right now, so don't worry too much about choosing the 'wrong' one.
* Learn to deploy your code to servers, using services like Heroku or Amazon Web Services, to have your projects visible live. You can deploy applications that do not have a back-end or database--applications such as a small set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files--for free on Github via Github Pages.
* Build projects to showcase every single aspect of your learning. Share all your best code on Github so others can see your portfolio and possibly even use the code you've written.
* Honestly, build as much as possible. Have ideas and work to make them happen.

# Other roadmaps

## Learning on your own
[Go from Zero to Programmer Hero in One Guide!](http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/learn-code/) But really there's a lot of [cool discussions](https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-designing-a-syllabus-to-take-a-newbie-like-me-from-a-coding-zero-to-a-Full-Stack-Web-Dev-Hero-in-6-months-and-under-1000-what-would-you-tell-me-to-learn-and-what-online-resources-should-I-use) about how to get into web development when you're a raw beginner to programming generally that are worth checking out.

* [Codecademy's Full Stack path](https://www.codecademy.com): Codecademy is an amazing first step on your road to code, especially if you have never written any code before. Great introduction to essential full stack concepts and competencies.
* ["How to Get a Developer Job In Less Than A Year"](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645#.wz90cqkwl): perspective from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/).
* [Essential things you need to know for Rails development](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/this-is-why-learning-rails-is-hard?__s=uvtabrbrcctximf9dhin): Rails is the major web framework for Ruby, and a popular choice for building apps quickly and well.

## Learning with some help
I really like the idea of [mastery learning](http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/09/how-startups-are-solving-a-decades-old-problem-in-education/), which is when you learn or are taught a concept until you master it, before moving on to the next one. Ideally, you do it with the help of a mentor or community. Here's some places to do that:

* [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming): completely free, Ruby-based full-stack development program, with an amazing online community.
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/): superb, completely free program, teaching from the front-end backwards, with an excellent and huge community which in many cities has local presence. Actively maintained and being expanded to include new courses such as one teaching D3.js.
* [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io/web-developer-career-track): a paid bootcamp whose model is to connect you with a developer who acts as a mentor.
* [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/): similarly to Bloc.io, a paid bootcamp program connecting you to a mentor.

In general, if you choose to go to a bootcamp, [get the most out of it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-steps-get-most-out-coding-bootcamp-tom-goldenberg?trk=hp-feed-article-title-publish).
