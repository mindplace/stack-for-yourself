  <h2>What StackForYourself is meant to be</h2>
  <p>This site is a place to find resources to support developers both new and experienced. Check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/roadmap/">roadmap</a> for an overview of how this site is intended to be used.</p>

  <p>My vision for this site was simple: to have a place on the internet where I can share all the resources I've collected since starting down the road to becoming a web developer. It beats out having a bunch of <a href="https://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> files sitting in a private location where no one else can see.</p>

  <p>As much as we've all been exposed to images of isolated geeks sitting in dark rooms bashing away at undecipherable programs on old-school terminals, code is a collaborative experience. We all get to contribute, share, support, and reuse code. This is one of my contributions.</p>
