basics:
  text: Set up your development environment.
  links:
    typing: Be able to type very well, quickly, and cleanly. Try <a href="https://typing.io">typing.io</a> to level up.
    tools: Get yourself a <a href="/everything-else/2016/05/01/managing-your-tools/">text editor, project management tools, and more</a>.
    command-line: You'll need to learn how to use <a href="/comp-sci/2016/10/01/command-line/">command line interfaces</a>. Terminal, bash/shell, Cygwin, and various other programs will allow you to have a textual interface to your computer, an essential part of writing code.

fundamentals:
  text: You need a foundational grasp of Computer Science concepts in order to think your way around code. You don't necessarily need this in order to build with code... but you do need it in order to understand what you're building and debugging.
  links:
    links: Check out <a href="/comp-sci/2016/10/01/general-uncategorized/">our list of fundamental computer science concepts</a>.
    roadmap: Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/" target="_blank"> this 2018 developer roadmap</a>. This a useful reference if you're wondering where a topic fits into your journey.
    variety: Variety of <a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/3671/20150528220118/https://www.extension.harvard.edu/open-learning-initiative/intensive-introduction-computer-science">free online Computer Science courses from universities</a>. These are often Computer Science courses that teach broad programming/computer concepts.
    compsci: Some great Computer Science <a href="http://videolectures.net/Top/Computer_Science/">video lectures</a>.

back-end-language:
  text: Learn a back-end language that plays nice with the web, like Ruby, Python, Go, C#, JavaScript via Node.js, PHP, or Java. Don't let yourself get lost in the crazy comparison-mongering crowds that tell you that Ruby is dying or Java is too hard. Every single one of these languages has an excellent history, great community of contributors and users, and makes buckets of cash for the companies that use them. Every one of these are great for web development for their own reasons.
  links:
    this: <a href="/back-end/2016/10/01/languages/">Back-end languages</a>

algorithms:
  text: Learn the language you've chosen by solving small problems, called algorithms. Then graduate to more challenging algorithims, learn and use data structures, and understand essential concepts like Object Oriented Programming. Everything you'll learn will only improve your grasp of the back-end language you've chosen.
  links:
    games: Create games for the console and write small programs, like <a href="https://github.com/mindplace/nifty_things/tree/master/To_do_list">to-do lists</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower of Hanoi</a> game.
    algorithms: <a href="/comp-sci/2016/09/01/algorithms-uncategorized/">Algorithms</a>. These are small code problems. Solving them demands a fluency with your chosen language, and they tend to really help you learn that language. They're an essential part of finding work as well, as most jobs reqiure that the applicant solve one or more algorithms at the technical interview.
    data-structures: <a href="/comp-sci/2016/08/01/data-structures/">Data strutures</a>. These are ways of organizing small bits of data that your program needs to have access to as the program is executed.

git:
  text: Learn the heck out of git.
  links:
    git: <a href="/comp-sci/2016/05/01/github/">Intro to git and Github</a>. These are cornerstone tools to a developer's workflow.

databases:
  text: Learn how to setup and use databases with your projects. Get really comfortable with SQL syntax.
  links:
    sql: Check out our <a href="/back-end/2016/08/01/databases-uncategorized/">introduction to databases</a> resource.

networking:
  text: Learn how the web works, how requests are made, where code lives, how servers listen for and respond to queries.
  links:
    internet: Our <a href="/back-end/2016/10/01/networking-basics/">introduction to networking</a>, or, an introduction to how the Internet works and how applications make and respond to requests.
    text: Learn a back-end web framework for the back-end language you chose. Back-end frameworks consist of files that are prewritten for you in the appropriate language, in order to take care of the initial setup of an application. They handle managing your database, creating the 'logic' of what your application can do, and they allow you to focus on working on the parts that are unique to your application instead of basic configurations that every application must have in order to be 'live' on a server. An example of a back-end web framework for Ruby is <a href="/2016/07/01/ruby-rails/">Rails</a>. Here's a <a href="https://www.unforgivableruby.com/post/114752678529/learning-web-developmentrails-without-spending">place to learn about web development concepts</a> within the context of Rails.

front-end-basics:
  text: Learn to create simple pages with HTML and CSS.
  links:
    ours: Check out our <a href="/front-end/2016/06/01/front-end-part-1-html-css-dom/">introduction to HTML, CSS, and the DOM</a>, or, Document Object Model.
    viking: <a href="https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/prep">Viking School prep course</a> is a lovely overall introduction to HTML and CSS.

javascript:
  text: Learn JavaScript. Be able to write vanilla JavaScript both in the sense of objects and in the sense of DOM manipulations.
  links:
    jquery: Learn more about the DOM and the way JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS. A great way to do that would be to learn the most popular JavaScript library, jQuery. Find that and other resources <a href="/front-end/2016/06/01/javascript-uncategorized/">here</a>.
    framework: Choose a <a href="/front-end/2016/06/01/front-end-frameworks/">front-end JavaScript framework</a> and learn it. Every modern framework has a great community and support right now, so don't worry too much about choosing the 'wrong' one.

next steps:
  text: Finally, showcase your work live, and build, build, build.
  links:
    github: Learn to deploy your code to servers, using services like Heroku or Amazon Web Services, to have your projects visible live. You can deploy applications that do not have a back-end or databases, applications such as a small set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, for free on Github via Github Pages.
    build: Build projects to showcase every single aspect of your learning. Share all your best code on Github so others can see your portfolio and possibly even use the code you've written.
